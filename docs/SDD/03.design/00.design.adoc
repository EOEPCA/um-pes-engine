= Building Block Design

[NOTE]
.Content Description
================================
This section contains:

* A concise breakdown of the Building Block in several independent services (when applicable). For each component, the following subsections are added:
** Overview and purpose: indicating the functionality covered by the component
** SW Reuse and Dependencies: indicating reuse of third party open source solutions (if any) and any pre-required Dependencies
** Interfaces: both internal to the building block and those exposed externally
** Data: Data usage of the building block, data flow and any GDPR concerns should be addressed here
** Applicable Resources: links and references to (Reference Docs), and repositories.

When a breakdown is necessary, a general overview of the building block can be given. On the contrary, no breakdown indicates a single component development with the same expected sections.

== Pricing Engine

=== Overview and Purpose
The Flask-based endpoint allows to query and retrieve information and values for the items in the requests. 

=== Software Reuse and Dependencies

All requirements for the executing of the reverse proxy are found under src/requirements.txt, and expect Python 3.6.9 or greater to work.

The most important are:

* **EOEPCA-SCIM**: Used as a complementary measure to the XACML passing of client assertions.
* **EOEPCA-OIDC**: Used to auto-register itself as a client to the Auth. Server upon start-up.
* **WellKnownHandler**: Used to dynamically check the configuration of the Authorization Server on each execution. For example, it can get the needed endpoints for any API the Pricing needs, such as the token request for OIDC.
* **Flask**: External to EOEPCA's project, this library allows the Pricing to expose its endpoints.
* **MongoDB**: Used to storage the policies for every resource, with the possibility of performing actions such as insert policies, modify, delete, etc

=== Interfaces

This component doesn't have any internal interfaces. For a reference of external interfaces see <<External Interfaces>> on Section 2 <<Overview>>

=== Data

==== Configuration

The Pricing Engine gets all its configuration from the file located under config/config.json.

The parameters that are accepted, and their meaning, are as follows:

To be determinated

==== Data flow

To be determinated

=== Extensibility

The design of the Pricing Engine allows for further improvements if need be. For example:

- Billing event to Pricing List interpretation 
- API Endpoints for Pricing Requests 
- Connection to local and remote pricing databases 
- Payments 
- Commercial users: register payment details
