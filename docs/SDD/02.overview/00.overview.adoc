* High-Level Description of the Building Block
* Context within EOEPCA
================================

The main functionality of the Pricing Engine is to support:

* The Billing Service during the generation of billing reports, calculation of rates and prices for a list of items within a Pricing Window. Disaggregating them when necessary, depending on the pricing models.
* The Authorization Phase, because the pricing engine can also be consulted for estimated resource use, to support the PDP on their requests to the Billing Service.

=== Initialization flow

The figure below, identifies the main workflows on which the Pricing Engine participates, along with it's components:

image::../images/pdp_flow.png[top=5%, align=right, pdfwidth=6.5in]


When launched, the PDP will answer to all requests to 2 specific paths:

. Policy Management (/policy/ and /policy/<policy_id or ObjectId(policy_id)>): To perform operations like GET/UPDATE/DELETE policies
. Policy Access Check (/policy/validate): to check the policy access to a resource using a xacml from the request
The requests should be accompained by an "Authorization: Bearer <valid_RPT>" for all endpoints except for the de /validate

Examples, given the example values of:
- path configured: "/pdp"
- PDP is at pdp.domain.com/policy
- For Validate policies: "/policy/validate"

|===
| Token | Request to PDP | PDP Action | PDP answer

| No RPT/OAuth token | pdp.domain.com | None (request does not get to PDP endpoint) | None (the PDP doesn't see this request)
| No RPT/OAuth token and Valid data | pdp.domain.com/policy/validate with a json as data | Validates the policy access related to the json request | Return a response with Permit access 
| No RPT/OAuth token and Not valid data | pdp.domain.com/policy/validate with a json as data | Validates the policy access related to the json request | Return a response with Deny access 
| RPT/OAuth token + Policy information as data  | pdp.domain.com/policy/ | Register Policy in the Back-end Database | Policy_id for the policy just created 
| No RPT/OAuth token + Policy information as data | pdp.domain.com/policy/ | Register Policy in Back-end Database | 401 
| RPT/OAuth token + Policy information as data | pdp.domain.com/policy/<policy_id or ObjectId(policy_id)> | Performs the operations of Get/Update/Delete policy  | Get: Return the policy Update: "updated" or "no changes made"  Delete: 204 if exists
| No RPT/OAuth token + Policy information as data | pdp.domain.com/policy/<policy_id or ObjectId(policy_id)> | Performs the operations of Get/Update/Delete policy | 401

== External Interfaces

=== Exposed Interfaces

==== XACML (from/to Login Service)

The PDP exposes a policy check endpoint compliant with XACML 3.0 standards (http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/xacml-3.0-core-spec-en.html), whith a content-type application/json due to its JSON Profile.

For the function of parse XACML requests to get a decision about the access to a policy, you can use `/policy/validate`.

==== Policy API (to Policy Decision Point)

The PDP queries the corresponding PDP to retrieve information about a policy.
For this case we can use the `/policy/<policy_id or ObjectId(policy_id)>` to do all the operations related to insert, get, update and delete policies.

=== Consumed Interfaces

==== OIDC (to Login Service) 

The PDP uses the OIDC protocol in order to authenticate itself as a valid UMA client, and uses this OIDC client in all UMA-related queries.It allows Clients to verify the identity of the End-User. (https://gluu.org/docs/gluu-server/4.0/admin-guide/openid-connect/)

These queries are done against the Login Service, and the endpoints used are:

* Discovery Endpoint: /.well-known/openid-configuration

And the keys used from Well Known Handler:

* Token Endpoint: KEY_OIDC_TOKEN_ENDPOINT
* UserInfo Endpoint: KEY_OIDC_USERINFO_ENDPOINT

==== SCIM (to Login Service)

The PDP has the capability to auto-register itself as a client if there is no client pre-configured from previous starts or previous configuration. In order to do this, it utilizes the SCIM protocol which is designed to reduce the complexity of user management operations. (https://gluu.org/docs/gluu-server/3.1.1/user-management/scim2/)

The keys used from Well Known Handler:

* User Atributes: KEY_SCIM_USER_ENDPOINT
* Private Key JWT Key: ENDPOINT_AUTH_CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY_JWT

== Internal Interfaces

=== Back-End database

In order to access the policies, these policies will be stored in a non-relational database. In which will be stored document-oriented information such as JSON-like documents with optional schemas.

== Required resources

This section contains:

* List of HW and SW required resources for the correct functioning of the building Block
* References to open repositories (when applicable)

=== Software

The following Open-Source Software is required to support the deployment and integration of the Policy Enforcement Point:

* EOEPCA's SCIM Client - https://github.com/EOEPCA/um-common-scim-client
* EOEPCA's OpenID - https://github.com/EOEPCA/um-common-oidc-client
* EOEPCA's Well Known Handler - https://github.com/EOEPCA/well-known-handler
* Flask - https://github.com/pallets/flask
* MongoDB for python - https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html

== Static Architecture

This section contains:

* Diagram and description of the major logical components within the Building Block

================================

With the diagram below, you can see how the connection between the back-end database and the pdp-engine:

image::../images/pdp_flow.png[top=5%, align=right, pdfwidth=6.5in]

The PDP is composed of two main components:

* The PDP Engine (related to the endpoint that are exposed): This component will expose the endpoints that we commented before. For this it will be necessary to establish a client for SCIM and another for OIDC.

* And a Back-end Database: This component store all information related to policies and will interact within the endpoints.

The next section <<mainDesign>>:: contains detailed descriptions and references needed to understand the intricacies of this component.

================================

=== Policy Access Check Use Case

image::../images/use_case.png[top=5%, align=center]

This diagram covers the following use cases:

==== Policy Access Check

When the PDP has obtained the policies, we proceed to compare the content of these policies with the values obtained from the request using the ScimHandler, mainly they are the resource id, action type, and the user_name, in case that some of these do not coincide, it will be response with "Deny" in the json or with a "Permit" if everything is correct.

==== Policy Retrieval

The PDP access through the resource id that was extracted from the XACML in the request and using the Policy_Storage class, allows to access the Back-end databse and extracts all the policies information stored for that resource id.

==== Get User Attributes

SCIM will be used in order to obtain the attributes for the user that have been extracted from the XACML of the request and then use them in the PDP functions. The issuer variable of the XACML subject-id field can be optionally used to determine the SCIM Endpoint on which the PDP will attempt to perform attribute release. If this value is not available, it will be extracted from configuration or environment variables.

=== Policy Repository Management

==== Registration of policies

The process of registering the policies is performed in the main, for this purpose the Policy_Storage class is used which will allow actions such as inserting policies in the pod where the Back-end database is located.

=== Policy Delegation (to external PDPs)

Whenever a policy rule has a **delegate** parameter with a reference URI to an external PDP, the current PDP will forward the xacml request to the external PDP referencing itself in it. The external PDP will validate the remaining policies (that were referenced with the **delegate** parameter). If the external PDP has the policy, it will return a permission granted on its side. If all the policy checks are positively validated (current PDP and foreign PDP(s)), the permission is granted. If otherwise any policy check fails to validate, the permission is denied.
